# Cornerstone-Mars-Rover
This is an arduino-based project for GE 1502 Cornerstone of Engineering 2 at Northeastern University. 
The project is running using Sparkfun Weather Shield, MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor, Sparkfun LCD Readout, as well as three separate servo motors and an IR sensor, able to receive IR input from a standard TV remote.

The Sensor_Code.ino sketch is solely for reading data from the sensors on the Weather Shield and the MQ-3 sensor. The Full_Rover_Code.ino sketch is the full sketch for robot operation
